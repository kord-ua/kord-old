# KORD PHP Framework

KORD is an elegant, open source, and object oriented HMVC framework built using PHP5. It aims to be swift, secure, and small. KORD framework is initially based on Kohana framework, but contains a lot of new features.

KORD framework is licensed under the BSD License. All original scripts (Kohana Framework, Zend Framework, phputf8 and other) are licensed under their original licenses.

## New features
* Complete PSR-compatibility: PSR-0 and PSR-4 for classes autoloading, PSR-1 and PSR-2 for coding style, PSR-3 for logging
* Requires PHP version >=5.4 - uses short array syntax, namespaces, class member access on instantiation, traits (coming soon)
* Advanced core multi-language support
* Many Kohana core classes are completely/partially rewritten (see below), some classes are based on Zend Framework classes (validation and filtration)

## Core classes changes

### Helpers

#### Date (KORD\Helper\Date)
* `Date::fuzzySpan()` and `Date::format()` are now internationalized. Based on [I18n_Plural](https://github.com/czukowski/I18n_Plural)

#### Num (KORD\Helper\Num)
* `ordinal(...)` and `round(...)` methods are deprecated and removed

#### Random (KORD\Helper\Random)
* Allows to generate random bytes, strings, integers, floats and booleans using OpenSSL or Mcrypt

#### Server (KORD\Helper\Server)
* Contains methods to handle $_SERVER array

#### UTF8 (KORD\Helper\UTF8)
* `iconv()` and `$charset` are used in `UTF8::strlen`, `UTF8::strtolower` and `UTF8::strtoupper` for better encoding compatibility (used in filtration/validation)
* Three separate functions to check if unicode (`unicodeEnabled()`) and mbstring (`mbstringEnabled()`) are enabled and if encoding is upported by mbstring (`mbstringEncodingSupported(...)`)

### Core (KORD\Core)
* I18n object is now being attached to Core and the following code:
`__('Translate me')`
is now equivalent to
`Core::$i18n->translate('Translate me')`.
Thus, multiple translators can be used within one application.

### Crypt

#### Encrypt (KORD\Crypt\Encrypt)
* Non-config setup (see KORD\Crypt\Encrypt::setInstance in bootstrap.php)

#### Hash (KORD\Crypt\Hash)
* Keyed/non-keyed hashes
* Multiple instances are supported like in KORD\Crypt\Encrypt

#### PasswordHash
* Bcrypt (Blowfish), PBKDF2 and hash_hmac password hashing mechanisms are supported
* Multiple instances are supported like in KORD\Crypt\Encrypt

### Exception (KORD\Exception)
* Exception placeholders are now with braces around context keys instead of colons (e.g. `throw new Exception("This {var} is invalid", ['var' => $var])` instead of `throw new Exception("This :var is invalid", [':var' => $var])`) according to section 1.2 of PSR-3

### Filtration (KORD\Filtration)
* Based on Zend Framework filters
* Multiple filters for one value are supported
* Filtration of both scalar values and arrays (e.g. multiselects) is now supported

### Form (KORD\Form)
* Contains areas (e.g. tabs), each area contains elements (inputs, selects, buttons etc.). 
* Multiple filters and validation rules (plus validation errors) can be assigned to each element
* Each element is bound to a view file (can be custom)
* Each element can be single-lingual or multi-lingual (one input instance per language, each is being validated and filtered separately)

### I18n (KORD\I18n)
* Based on [I18n_Plural](https://github.com/czukowski/I18n_Plural)
* Multiple readers are supported

### Log (KORD\Log)
* PSR-3 compatible

### Request (KORD\Request)
* Kohana Request `directory` property is deprecated and removed as namespaces are now being used

### Route (KORD\Route and KORD\Route\Repository)
* Initialized routes are now being stored in a separate class (repository)
* Routes do not contain `directory` param (see KORD\Request)

### Security

#### XSS (KORD\Security\XSS) (is a part of HTMLPurifier module)
* Allows to remove XSS (and broken HTML) from text or array of strings using HTMLPurifier module

### Session (KORD\Session)
* Basic session fixation protection and session hijacking protection
* When session id expires (session fixation protection) old session is still available for 30 seconds e.g. for ajax calls
* Native PHP sessions can now be encrypted

### Validation (KORD\Validation)
* Validation rules are based on Zend Framework validators
* Rules are combined into chains, chains can be broken on first validation rule check failure (one error message), or all validation rules will be checked (one error message per failed validation rule)
* Validation of both scalar values and arrays (e.g. multiselects) is now supported

## Modules

### Database
* MySQL driver is deprecated and removed. PDO and MySQLi drivers are available.
* `list_tables` and `list_columns` methods are deprecated and removed as they are not supported by PDO

### HTMLPurifer
* Uses [HTMLPurifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/)
* Multiple HTMLPurifer instances are supported

### ORM
* Table columns are now being cached
* Validation and filtration inside ORM is removed
